                <p id='text'>I'm a first-generations Latinx undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Data Science with an emphasis in Sustainable Development and Engineering. On-campus, I'm a Lead Undergraduate Student Instructor for the class Data 8: Foundations of Data Science where I am pioneering the Data Scholars Foundations Program, a co-created diverse space that advances historically underrepresented students in the field. I have led the program's growth from 30 scholars to 120 scholars in the 2021-2022 academic year.</p>
                <p id='text'>I grew up in Baldwin Park, CA and have had an interest in technology since the day I got an iPod Nano 4th Generation back in 2008. It was an incredible device and I had to knew how it worked, so I continued with the idea of pursuing coding in higher education. I landed in Data Science, a field that combines computational and inferential thinking with a domain emphasis. A huge support in making this happen are the scholarships that I receieved, such as "The Gates Scholarship" from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the "HSF Scholarship" from the Hispanic Scholarship Fund.</p>
                <p id='text'>In my freetime, I really enjoy trying out local coffee shops and restaurants with friends!</p>
